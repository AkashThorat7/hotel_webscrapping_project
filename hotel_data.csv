Taste was rather plain

The restaurant is quite nice and has a good layout. The staff is prompt and the chef was personally looking after the needs of the customers. He even served items that were not laid out in the buffet.

"The approach of Front Desk Manager could be better,he behaves like he is so much busy and not attending the guests properly. While going towards the rooms after the check in, he comes and stops us at the lift lobby to take the picture of us. Taking picture is not that problem ,but the way he did, its very disregardful. Such a brand like Radisson blue deserves some smart managers who can handle its customers very elegantly and politely.

"All minor issues: 
Made several calls just to get room cleaned.  Room layout was odd- bathroom door should come out from hallway not from bed area- this would help with privacy.  The AC is at a fixed temperature.  The small refrigerator wasn’t that effective at keeping items cold.  If the hotel is hosting business meetings, the meeting room and lobby areas can become quite noisy.

Great location- close to shops and restaurants.  Front reception staff are very friendly and accommodating.  Decent sized rooms and quiet.  Minibar at MRP.

"The Superior room mentions a lot of amenities in the room but they are unavailable like Iron and Iron Board, hair dryer and most important the safe locker.
The room service gave me an alternative of an ashtray (picture attached). The bowl like thing was the cover of a potty cleaner brush.
 During our stay all the requests made whether it was for amenities or even taking the luggage during check out we're delayed and had to do multiple followups for the same. I am not sure why there was such lack of service.
It's useless to request anything to the Operator, Room Service and Guest relations as they tend to ignore all the requests.
The property caters to corporate clients maybe that's the reason. 
I wouldn't recommend families to book here though it is near to local shopping streets because it lacks service and hospitality. 
Staying in a Five star property and to loose my cool to get things done and be heard is the last thing I would appreciate.

The check in was smooth, however we were assigned a superior room instead of a Business High floor room. The amenities in the room were not available as mentioned, hence had reached out to Ms. Alisha Bansal next day to inform her about the inconveniences faced and she immediately upgraded our room to a suite and complemented it with a family dinner at Timpana. Thank you to Ms. Alisha from the Operations and Shahid (Timpana Rest.) to turnaround the bad experience we had on the first day.

"Room service was very under average- rooms were not regularly cleaned and if they did took alot of time. Amenities were hardly replaced.Billing was the worst experience and didn't expect this from a 4star hotel- They clubed someone else's room bills with me and tried  tried to charge me 15000 rs extra. They couldn't produce the signed copy of extra restaurant meals etc added to my room. My parents had already checked out their room on 19th but they wanted to charge me for their room until 21st.. don't know why. Many glitches in billing systems and ruined the over all experience in the end..Please check your billing system.

Best part of the stay was staff especially the doormen and the valet parking people. They were totally amazing and helpful. Most respectful and by far made my experience the best in India.I loved the on-spot services. Things reached your rooms as soon as you asked for something like bottle of water etc.

"It's surprising to see that brand like Radisson is not keeping up the standards. I have highlighted the issues to the duty manager Shubham, on my last trip also the problem were similar.  
Alexa was not working. 
Complimentary fruits were not kept in the room.
Carpet was not clean, it was full of dust plus discarded wrappers were there in the room corners. Plastic bottles were kept in the room. Minibar was empty.  
As I have faced the issues in my previous stay, this time, I have personally called a day before and spoken to Roshni and told her to keep the room ready and I am allergic to dust but still it was the same.
Also, my previous bookings were through Booking.com, the booking process is not yet completed from Radisson team, have given multiple reminders.

"We used 4 rooms in total - The staff are extremely slow. Service is delayed for almost anything you request. Be it with attending to calls on time or with respect to housekeeping and in room services. They don’t even have enough towels. And don’t replace the used towels with new. On requesting for a replacement for the towels taken, they ask us to wait until the used ones are cleaned and dry.
Every room service they bring in, they don’t bring up the required number of plates wrt the number of guests checked in. And every meal we had to request extra plates which were forgotten and had to be called for again at least 2-3 times. Every in room meal order, specific orders of salad, papads and dahi were forgotten.
The junior suite which is fully automated with built in remote systems are dysfunctional. There is no way to operate the aspects of the room like adjusting room temperature, opening/closing of windows, switching on/off the lights. Everything needs to be controlled only with Alexa and that’s not possible because their Internet does not connect. We had to call for the service technician to come to adjust the freezing temperature in one room and how hot it was in the adjoining living room because the remote panels in the room weren’t working. The staff didn’t attend to us even after waiting for more than 1.5 hours and calling repeatedly more than 3-4 times. (We even requested saying that my 3 year old is freezing). They came up to attend to the call only when they needed their agenda to be met.
To top this, each and every time we called for any requests, the staff would just use their key card and enter the room without giving us enough time to answer the door. (They knew we were inside because we had placed calls specifically). I don’t know how this is acceptable. This was the most audacious of things and totally unacceptable.
Overall some staff and almost all the housekeeping are shockingly inefficient and least bit remorseful about their inefficiency.

Location was convenient. Fairly accessible with a metro station quite nearby. The property was good. The breakfast spread was good too.

"Unfortunately stay at property is most disheartening as this property has 5 star rating. Would expect certain standards. 
15% was not applied until advised on 4 day. 
It does not deliver. 
Rooms are tired, dirty (needs a deep clean) and also in of brightening up. 
Staff are polite but unfortunately you have to keep asking or lack of what you are trying to get across leaves you frustrated. Tea takes to long to come at breakfast you are almost finished or waiting time for puri is the same you’ve finished dinner before it arrives just some instances. No salt and pepper on tables always have to ask. No tissues on tables. 
Last night I witnessed 7-8 children running and shouting in restaurant nothing was done until I asked manager to have a word yet they continued, mention this to reception this morning and was told nothing they can do. This again is not what you expect from a 5 star hotel. 
Spa is ok again dated and unclean. Rooms are not ready for when you attend you have to wait. Cold rooms with loud staff while having a full body massage is not what you want. 
Parking had to be on street most days although we had two rooms as no space. Driver collecting us asked to wait on road. 
Roof top restaurant was not open in December and space not available to relax. 
Pool is pretty to look at but unusable due to monkey pee and poo. (Witnessed them cleaning and stinging from it too). 
Gym was used three occasions all of which there was no water available and no towels. Had to ring reception, music was not on and air-con was off.  
No hairdryer or ironing board available in room.

Food was exceptional and of good varied great quantity very night. so many chalices for breakfast and dinner.

I was told it is subject to availability and will incur some charges but we had to pay full day charge. If this is hotel's policy it must be conveyed before when early checkin was requested. In February '22 we arrived at the same time and were allowed early checkin without any extra cost. I understand it is no way our right to check in early but there should be a clear policy. Room was only available if we pay full day charge which I felt was a cheeky way.

After an hour they served me some thing where spices are not cooked properly and lamb taste is not at all good. I thought, it's my mistake having food there so continuing but after a few spoons, it is full of salt. I complained and they also accepted. Again they served me a new plate taking further 25 mins.
